**SUBJECT: V3 Plugin Logic & Pine Integration - Integrity Audit**

Hey Devin, I have reviewed the V5 Plugin documentation you created here:
`C:\Users\Ansh Shivaay Gupta\Downloads\ZepixTradingBot-New-v1\ZepixTradingBot-old-v2-main\Trading_Bot_Documentation\V5_BIBLE\10_V3_COMBINED_PLUGIN.md`

And the feature specs here:
`C:\Users\Ansh Shivaay Gupta\Downloads\ZepixTradingBot-New-v1\ZepixTradingBot-old-v2-main\Trading_Bot_Documentation\V5_BIBLE\FEATURES_SPECIFICATION.md`

**It is clear that your work does not match the original integration plan.**

I created comprehensive documentation for the original bot logic, intending for it to be integrated *exactly* into the plugin features.

**Your Task:**

1.  **Read the Source Logic:** Read all 5 files in this folder carefully:
    `C:\Users\Ansh Shivaay Gupta\Downloads\ZepixTradingBot-New-v1\ZepixTradingBot-old-v2-main\Updates\v5_hybrid_plugin_architecture\COMBINED LOGICS`

2.  **Self-Audit:** Compare this documentation against your code. Check yourself: **Did you implement every single line of this logic for the plugin update, or did you skip significant parts?** Scan your complete bot code files to verify this.

3.  **Pine Script Compatibility:** To help you understand better, I am providing the V3 Pine Script that powers this strategy.
    `C:\Users\Ansh Shivaay Gupta\Downloads\ZepixTradingBot-New-v1\ZepixTradingBot-old-v2-main\Important_Doc_Trading_Bot\05_Unsorted\TRADINGVIEW_PINE_SCRIPT\ZEPIX_ULTIMATE_BOT_v3.0_FINAL.pine`

**Final Question to Answer:**
Verify if your upgraded V3 plugin system is actually correct. Can the bot truly understand **all** the data sent by this Pine Script? Can it determine exactly what to do based on that data?

**Report your findings honestly.**
