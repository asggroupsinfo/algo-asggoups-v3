# 📜 PRESERVE AND ENRICH STRATEGY (CLARIFICATION)

## 🎯 USER MANDATE
**"Purane docs ko aur naye docs ko MERGE karke ek single Ultimate Bible (`docs/V5_BIBLE/`) banao."**
**"Don't just copy-paste. Do NOT just delete. SYNTHESIZE."**

## 📖 REFERENCE SOURCE
This clarification is based on the logic defined in:
`updates/v5_hybrid_plugin_architecture/12_DOCUMENTATION_MERGE/CLARIFICATION/00_PRESERVE_AND_ENRICH.md`

## 🛠️ THE MERGE PROTOCOL (STEP-BY-STEP)

1.  **READ & MAP (The Truth):**
    *   Read `DOCUMENTATION/` to understand *Logic Intent* (Legacy Features).
    *   Read `src/` to understand *Actual Implementation* (V5 Plugins).
    *   Map them: Feature X in Old Doc = `Plugin Y` in V5 Code.

2.  **CREATE THE DEEP DIVES (The Core):**
    *   `docs/V5_BIBLE/V3_LOGIC_DEEP_DIVE.md` (Trace 12 signals -> Plugin Bridge -> Trade).
    *   `docs/V5_BIBLE/V6_LOGIC_DEEP_DIVE.md` (Trace Price Action -> Multi-TF Check -> Execution).
    *   `docs/V5_BIBLE/ARCHITECTURE_DEEP_DIVE.md` (Visual Diagram of Plugin Wiring).
    *   `docs/V5_BIBLE/BOT_WORKFLOW_CHAIN.md` (Visual Chain: Startup -> Data -> Trade).

3.  **SYNTHESIZE & RELOCATE (The Merge):**
    *   **Rule:** Create `docs/V5_BIBLE/` and MOVE/MERGE all content there.
    *   **NO DUPLICATION:** Do not keep `DOCUMENTATION/` or `updates/.../06_DOCUMENTATION_BIBLE/`. Delete old folders ONLY after successful merge.
    *   **Enrichment:** Use Legacy details to describe V5 implementations.

4.  **REPORT:**
    *   Generate `docs/V5_BIBLE/00_INDEX.md` as the single point of truth.

**DO NOT STOP UNTIL THERE IS ONLY ONE DOCUMENTATION FOLDER.**
