### Phase: COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING

**Objective:**  
Create a **COMPLETE, COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING DOCUMENT FOLDER** that addresses ALL problems and ensures successful V5 Hybrid Plugin Architecture Part-1 implementation.

---

---

### Step 2: CREATE COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING FOLDER

**Create This Structure:**

```
03_SURGERY_PLANS/
└── COMPREHENSIVE_PLANS/               # NEW FOLDER
    ├── 00_MASTER_PLAN_INDEX.md       # Master index of all plans
    ├── 01_[Plan_Name].md              # Plan 1
    ├── 02_[Plan_Name].md              # Plan 2
    ├── 03_[Plan_Name].md              # Plan 3
    ├── ... (as many as needed)
    └── XX_[Final_Plan].md             # Last plan
```

---

### Step 3: DECIDE HOW MANY PLANS ARE NEEDED

**YOU decide:**
- How many plans are required? (Could be 10, 15, 20, 25... your decision)
- What should each plan cover?
- What is the logical grouping?
- What is the execution sequence?

**Constraints:**
- Address ALL 10 critical gaps from Report 4
- Address ALL 8 hidden discoveries from Report 4
- Include your previous 7 plans (update/merge as needed)
- Ensure 100% coverage of V5 requirements
- Ensure bot remains 100% functional at every step

---

### Step 4: EACH PLAN MUST INCLUDE

**Standard Structure for Every Plan:**

```markdown
# PLAN XX: [Plan Name]

## 1. OBJECTIVE
[What this plan achieves]

## 2. SCOPE
**In-Scope:**
- [What this plan covers]

**Out-of-Scope:**
- [What this plan does NOT cover]

## 3. CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
[Reference Study Reports - what exists now]

## 4. GAPS ADDRESSED
[Which gaps from Report 4 this plan fixes]

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
[Detailed, granular steps - be VERY specific]

Step 1: [Action]
- File: [exact file path]
- Code Change: [what to modify]
- Reason: [why needed]

Step 2: [Action]
...

## 6. DEPENDENCIES
**Prerequisites:**
- [What must be done before this plan]

**Blocks:**
- [What this plan blocks]

## 7. FILES AFFECTED
- [Exact file paths]

## 8. TESTING STRATEGY
[How to verify this plan works]

## 9. ROLLBACK PLAN
[How to undo if this plan fails]

## 10. SUCCESS CRITERIA
[How we know this plan is complete]

## 11. REFERENCES
- Study Report X, Section Y
- Planning Doc: 01_PLANNING/ZZ_DOC.md
- Original Surgery Plan: 03_SURGERY_PLANS/0X_PLAN.md
```

### Step 5: CREATE MASTER INDEX

**File:** `00_MASTER_PLAN_INDEX.md`

**Must Include:**

1. **Plan Summary Table:**
   | Plan # | Plan Name | Priority | Estimated Time | Dependencies |
   |--------|-----------|----------|----------------|--------------|
   | 01 | ... | P0 | X days | None |
   | 02 | ... | P0 | X days | Plan 01 |

2. **Dependency Graph:**
   ```
   Plan 01 → Plan 02 → Plan 05
           ↘ Plan 03 → Plan 06
   ```

3. **Execution Sequence:**
   - Phase 1: Plans 01-03 (Core)
   - Phase 2: Plans 04-07 (Re-entry)
   - Phase 3: Plans 08-10 (Orders)
   - ...

4. **Coverage Matrix:**
   - Which plan addresses which gap
   - Which plan implements which V5 requirement

5. **Total Timeline Estimate:**
   - Implementation: X weeks
   - Testing: Y weeks
   - Total: Z weeks

---

## 🧠 YOUR AUTONOMOUS DECISIONS

**YOU must decide:**

1. **How to group problems into logical plans?**  
   - By feature? (Re-entry Plan, Dual Order Plan, etc.)
   - By layer? (Core Plan, Service Plan, Telegram Plan, etc.)
   - By priority? (Critical Plans, High Plans, etc.)
   - Mixed approach?

2. **Which of your old 7 plans are still valid?**
   - Keep as-is?
   - Update/expand?
   - Merge with new plans?
   - Discard?

3. **How to sequence the plans?**
   - What must be done first?
   - What can be done in parallel?
   - What must wait?

4. **How detailed should each plan be?**
   - High-level overview vs granular steps?
   - Code snippets included?
   - Pseudocode vs actual code?
