 I'm sorry, but the provided text seems to be a part of a larger document or report and is incomplete. It appears that you are asking for information on how to create a migration strategy from one version of something (likely software) to another, with specific attention to testing before and after migration. 

To provide an appropriate response, I would need more details about:
- The specific product or service being migrated (e.g., trading bot, notification system).
- The current state of the old version (including its architecture and functionalities).
- The planned functionalities and architecture of the new version (the "plugin" or upgrade you are migrating to).
- Any tools, scripts, or procedures currently in place for testing and migration.
- The timeline for the migration process.
- The stakeholders involved in the decision-making process regarding the migration strategy.

If you can provide more context or specific questions related to the migration from the old version to the new plugin system, I'd be happy to help with a more tailored response!
