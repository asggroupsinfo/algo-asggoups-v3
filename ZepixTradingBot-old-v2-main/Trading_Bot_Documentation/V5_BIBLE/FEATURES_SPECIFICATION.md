### Multi-Timeframe Pillar Analysis

V3 system analyzes signals across 4 strategic timeframes:
- **15m**: Short-term momentum shifts
- **1h**: Intraday trend confirmation
- **4h**: Swing structure validation
- **1d**: Major trend alignment

**Configuration**: `v3_integration.mtf_pillars_only: ["15m", "1h", "4h", "1d"]`

### Consensus Scoring System

**Minimum Consensus Score**: 5 (configurable)

Scoring logic evaluates:
- Cross-timeframe signal alignment
- Trend coherence across pillars
- Momentum convergence
- Support/resistance confluence

**High-conviction signals** (score ≥ 5) receive priority routing.

### Signal Classification

**Aggressive Reversal Signals** (high risk, high reward):
- `Liquidity_Trap_Reversal`: Counter-trend liquidity grabs
- `Golden_Pocket_Flip`: Fibonacci golden zone reversals
- `Screener_Full_Bullish`: All-timeframe bullish alignment
- `Screener_Full_Bearish`: All-timeframe bearish alignment

**Conservative Exit Signals** (capital preservation):
- `Bullish_Exit`: Momentum exhaustion on longs
- `Bearish_Exit`: Momentum exhaustion on shorts

### Dynamic Signal Routing

V3 routes signals to optimal logic based on timeframe and type:

| Signal Source | Default Route | Override Conditions |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 5m signals | LOGIC1 (Scalping) | - |
| 15m signals | LOGIC2 (Intraday) | - |
| 1h signals | LOGIC3 (Swing) | - |
| 4h signals | LOGIC3 (Swing) | - |
| Any timeframe | LOGIC3 Override | If `Screener_Full_Bullish/Bearish` |
| Higher TF | LOGIC3 Override | If `Golden_Pocket_Flip` |

**Configuration Path**: `v3_integration.signal_routing`

### Trend Check Bypass

**Feature**: Optional bypass of standard trend alignment checks for V3 entries  
**Status**: Enabled (`bypass_trend_check_for_v3_entries: true`)

**Rationale**: High-consensus V3 signals (score ≥ 5) are sufficiently validated by multi-timeframe analysis, allowing profitable counter-trend entries.

### V3 Order Strategy Integration

V3 system powers the hybrid dual-order approach:

**Order A - V3 Smart SL**:
- SL system: SL-1.1 (logic-specific dynamic SL)
- Re-entry: Pyramid capability enabled
- Target: TP continuation for compounding

**Order B - Fixed Risk**:
- SL system: SL-2.1 (adaptive $10 max risk)
- Re-entry: Profit booking chain integration
- Target: Individual order profit threshold ($7 minimum)

---

# Feature 2: Multi-Timeframe Signal Processing System

The bot processes five types of trading signals from TradingView webhooks:

**Signal Types:**

| Type | Purpose | Valid Signals | Action |
|------|---------|---------------|--------|
| `bias` | Long-term market direction | bull, bear | Updates trend state |
| `trend` | Timeframe-specific trend | bull, bear | Updates trend state |
| `entry` | Trade entry signal | buy, sell | Executes trade if aligned |
| `reversal` | Trend reversal signal | reversal_bull, reversal_bear | Closes opposing trades |
| `exit` | Exit warning signal | bull, bear | Closes opposing trades |

**Validation Rules:**
- All signals must include: type, symbol, signal, tf (timeframe)
- Timeframe must be one of: 5m, 15m, 1h, 1d
- Symbol must be in supported list (10 symbols)
- Duplicate alerts within 5-minute window are rejected

**Alert Format:**
```json
{
    "type": "entry",
    "symbol": "XAUUSD",
    "signal": "buy",
    "tf": "15m",
    "price": 2650.50,
    "strategy": "LOGIC2"
}
```

### 2.1 Dual Order System

**V3 Hybrid Strategy**: Every entry signal creates two independent orders with complementary approaches:

**Order A (TP Trail - V3 Smart SL)**
- Uses V3 Smart SL system with TP continuation capability
- Can continue trading after hitting TP
- Integrates with profit booking pyramid for re-entry
- SL varies by logic (LOGIC1: 20 pips, LOGIC2: 40 pips, LOGIC3: 50 pips)

**Order B (Profit Trail - Fixed Risk)**  
- Uses adaptive SL calculated for $10 maximum risk/loss
- **SL in pips varies** based on lot size and symbol
- Dedicated to profit booking chains
- Tracks profit progression independently
- Example: 0.01 lot on XAUUSD = ~5 pip SL, 0.10 lot = ~0.5 pip SL

**Independence:**
- Both orders use the same lot size
- If Order A fails, Order B still executes
- No rollback mechanism - partial success is acceptable
- Each order tracked separately in database

**Configuration:**
```json
{
    "dual_order_enabled": true,
    "order_a_enabled": true,
    "order_b_enabled": true
}
```

## 2.3 Multi-Timeframe Logic

The bot implements three V3-powered timeframe-based logics:

**LOGIC1 - V3 Scalping Mode (5m entries)**
- Entry timeframe: 5m
- Lot multiplier: 1.25x (aggressive)
- SL multiplier: 1.0x (standard)
- Trend requirement: 1H + 15M aligned
- V3 routing: 5m signals → LOGIC1

**LOGIC2 - V3 Intraday Mode (15m entries)**
- Entry timeframe: 15m  
- Lot multiplier: 1.0x (balanced)
- SL multiplier: 1.5x (wider)
- Trend requirement: 1H + 15M aligned
- V3 routing: 15m signals → LOGIC2

**LOGIC3 - V3 Swing Mode (1h entries)**
- Entry timeframe: 1h
- Lot multiplier: 0.625x (conservative)
- SL multiplier: 2.5x (widest)
- Trend requirement: 1D + 1H aligned
- V3 routing: 1h/4h signals, Screener Full, Golden Pocket → LOGIC3

**Configuration:**
```json
{
    "timeframe_specific_config": {
        "enabled": true,
        "LOGIC1": {
            "lot_multiplier": 1.25,
            "sl_multiplier": 1.0
        },
        "LOGIC2": {
            "lot_multiplier": 1.0,
            "sl_multiplier": 1.5
        },
        "LOGIC3": {
            "lot_multiplier": 0.625,
            "sl_multiplier": 2.5
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Trend Alignment System

Trades only execute when higher timeframe trends align with entry direction.

**Alignment Rules:**

| Logic | Entry TF | Required Alignment |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| LOGIC1 | 5m | 1H BULLISH + 15M BULLISH for BUY |
| LOGIC2 | 15m | 1H BULLISH + 15M BULLISH for BUY |
| LOGIC3 | 1h | 1D BULLISH + 1H BULLISH for BUY |

**Trend Modes:**
- **AUTO**: Trend updated automatically by incoming signals
- **MANUAL**: Trend locked, not updated by signals (user override)

**Trend Storage:**
```json
{
    "XAUUSD": {
        "5m": {"trend": "BULLISH", "mode": "AUTO"},
        "15m": {"trend": "BULLISH", "mode": "AUTO"},
        "1h": {"trend": "BEARISH", "mode": "MANUAL"},
        "1d": {"trend": "BULLISH", "mode": "AUTO"}
    }
}
```

## Risk Management Features

## 3.1 Account Tier System

Dynamic lot sizing based on account balance (using ≥ logic):

| Account Tier | Balance Threshold (≥) | Base Lot Size | Daily Loss Limit | Lifetime Loss Limit |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| $5,000 | ≥ $5,000 | 0.01 | $100 | $500 |
| $10,000 | ≥ $10,000 | 0.02 | $200 | $1,000 |
| $25,000 | ≥ $25,000 | 0.125 | $500 | $2,500 |
| $50,000 | ≥ $50,000 | 0.50 | $1,000 | $5,000 |
| $100,000 | ≥ $100,000 | 1.00 | $2,000 | $10,000 |

**Tier Assignment**: Balance is checked sequentially from highest to lowest tier. First matching tier (where balance ≥ tier threshold) is assigned.

**Manual Lot Override Example** (from config):
- $5,000 tier manually overridden to 0.04 lots (instead of default 0.01)

**Tier Detection:**
```python
def get_risk_tier(balance):
    if balance < 10000:
        return "5000"
    elif balance < 25000:
        return "10000"
    elif balance < 50000:
        return "25000"
    elif balance < 100000:
        return "50000"
    else:
        return "100000"
```

## 5.1 Daily Loss Limits

Account tier-based daily limits:

- $5,000 tier: $100/day
- $10,000 tier: $200/day
- $25,000 tier: $500/day
- $50,000 tier: $1,000/day
- $100,000 tier: $2,000/day

**Daily Reset Time**: 03:35 UTC (configured in `daily_reset_time`)

Trading halts when limit reached, automatically resumes after daily reset.

**Lifetime Loss Cap:**
- Cumulative loss since last reset
- Manual reset required via Telegram command
- Trading paused when limit reached
- Protects against extended drawdowns

**Smart Lot Adjustment:**
When approaching daily limit, lot size is automatically reduced:
```python
remaining_risk = daily_cap - daily_loss
if remaining_risk < normal_risk:
    adjusted_lot = calculate_lot_for_risk(remaining_risk)
```

### 4.1.1 Stop Loss Systems

Two SL systems available:

**SL-1.1 (Dynamic RR-based)**
- Adjusts based on risk-reward ratio
- Varies by logic:
  - LOGIC1: 20.0 pips
  - LOGIC2: 40.0 pips
  - LOGIC3: 50.0 pips
- Used for Order A (TP Trail)

**SL-2.1 (Fixed Risk)**  
- Fixed $10 maximum risk/loss (not fixed pips)
- Actual SL in pips calculated: `$10 / (lot_size × pip_value)`
- Used for Order B (Profit Trail)
- Example variations:
  - 0.01 lot XAUUSD: ~5 pips SL
  - 0.10 lot XAUUSD: ~0.5 pips SL

**Symbol-Specific Configuration:**
```json
{
    "sl_systems": {
        "sl-1": {
            "name": "ORIGINAL",
            "description": "Standard SL system",
            "symbols": {
                "XAUUSD": {
                    "5000": {"sl_pips": 100, "risk_dollars": 10},
                    "10000": {"sl_pips": 100, "risk_dollars": 20}
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Symbol SL Reductions:**
Individual symbols can have percentage-based SL reductions:
```json
{
    "symbol_sl_reductions": {
        "EURUSD": 10,
        "GBPUSD": 15
    }
}
```

### 8. Manual Lot Override

        "5000": 0.03,
        "10000": 0.08
    }
}
```

## Profit Booking Features

## 2.2 Profit Booking Chain System

**Individual Order Booking Strategy**: Each order in the pyramid is booked when it reaches the minimum profit threshold.

**Current Configuration** (Levels 0-2 enabled, 3-4 disabled):

| Level | Orders | Min Profit/Order | SL Reduction | Status |
|-------|--------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| 0 | 1 | $7.00 | 0% | ✅ Enabled |
| 1 | 2 | $7.00 | 10% | ✅ Enabled |
| 2 | 4 | $7.00 | 25% | ✅ Enabled |
| 3 | 8 | $7.00 | 40% | ❌ Disabled (Config) |
| 4 | 16 | $7.00 | 50% | ❌ Disabled (Config) |

**Booking Mechanism**:
- Each individual order is monitored for profit
- When any order reaches ≥ $7.00 PnL, it is immediately booked
- Remaining orders in the same level continue trading
- Level progression occurs only when ALL orders at current level are closed

**Note**: `enabled_levels` in config controls which levels are active. Levels 3-4 can be enabled if desired.

**Profit Target:**
- Fixed $7 minimum profit per order
- Individual order booking (not combined)
- Dynamic PnL monitoring every 30 seconds

**Chain Progression:**
1. Order reaches $7 profit
2. Order is closed (profit booked)
3. When all orders at level closed, progress to next level
4. Place new orders at next level (2x previous count)
5. Continue until Level 4 or chain stopped

**Configuration:**
```json
{
    "profit_booking_config": {
        "enabled": true,
        "min_profit_per_order": 7,
        "max_level": 4,
        "multipliers": [1, 2, 4, 8, 16],
        "sl_reductions": [0, 10, 25, 40, 50]
    }
}
```

### 10. Profit SL Mode

Special SL calculation for profit booking orders.

**Modes:**
- **FIXED**: Fixed $10 SL for all profit orders
- **DYNAMIC**: SL based on profit target and lot size

**Calculation:**
```python
def calculate_profit_sl(entry, direction, lot_size, risk_amount=10):
    pip_value = get_pip_value(symbol, lot_size)
    sl_pips = risk_amount / pip_value
    sl_distance = sl_pips * pip_size
    
    if direction == "buy":
        return entry - sl_distance
    else:
        return entry + sl_distance
```

## Re-entry Features

### 11. SL Hunt Recovery System

Autonomous recovery after stop-loss hit.

**Recovery Process:**
1. SL hit detected
2. Chain enters "recovery_mode"
3. Price monitored for recovery
4. If price recovers 70% toward original entry:
   - Recovery trade placed
   - Tighter SL (reduced by configured percentage)
   - Same direction as original trade

**Recovery Window:**
- Default: 60 minutes
- Configurable per symbol
- Timeout results in chain closure

**Configuration:**
```json
{
    "re_entry_config": {
        "sl_hunt_recovery": {
            "enabled": true,
            "recovery_threshold": 0.7,
            "recovery_window_minutes": 60,
            "sl_reduction_percent": 20,
            "max_recovery_attempts": 3
        }
    }
}
```

### 12. TP Continuation System

Continue trading after take-profit hit.

**Continuation Process:**
1. TP hit detected
2. Check if trend still aligned
3. If aligned, place continuation trade:
   - Same direction
   - Reduced SL (progressive reduction)
   - New TP based on RR ratio

**Progressive SL Reduction:**
| Level | SL Reduction |
|-------|--------------|
| 1 | 0% |
| 2 | 10% |
| 3 | 25% |
| 4 | 40% |
| 5 | 50% |

**Configuration:**
```json
{
    "re_entry_config": {
        "tp_continuation": {
            "enabled": true,
            "max_levels": 5,
            "sl_reductions": [0, 10, 25, 40, 50],
            "require_trend_alignment": true
        }
    }
}
```

### 13. Exit Continuation System

Re-entry after exit signal with price gap.

**Process:**
1. Exit signal closes trade
2. Monitor for price gap (pullback)
3. If price pulls back sufficiently:
   - Place re-entry trade
   - Same direction as original
   - Tighter SL

**Configuration:**
```json
{
    "re_entry_config": {
        "exit_continuation": {
            "enabled": true,
            "min_gap_pips": 20,
            "max_wait_minutes": 30
        }
    }
}
```

### 14. Profit Booking SL Hunt

**Safety Limits:**
```json
{
    "autonomous_config": {
        "safety_limits": {
            "daily_recovery_attempts": 10,
            "daily_recovery_losses": 5,
            "max_concurrent_recoveries": 3,
            "profit_protection_multiplier": 5
        }
    }
}
```

### 16. Price Monitor Service

**Monitoring Interval:** 30 seconds

**Monitored Events:**
- SL hunt recovery opportunities
- TP continuation opportunities
- Exit continuation opportunities
- Profit booking target checks

### 17. Profit Protection

Skip recovery if existing profit is too valuable.

**Logic:**
```python
if total_profit > (potential_loss * protection_multiplier):
    skip_recovery()  # Protect existing profits
```

### 4.2.2 Recovery Windows

After SL hunt protection triggers, symbol-specific recovery windows apply:

| Symbol | Recovery Window | Rationale |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| XAUUSD | 15 minutes | High volatility, faster mean reversion |
| GBPJPY | 10 minutes | Extremely volatile pair |
| AUDJPY | 10 minutes | Yen pair volatility |
| EURUSD | 30 minutes | Major pair, moderate volatility |
| GBPUSD | 30 minutes | Major pair, moderate volatility |
| USDJPY | 30 minutes | Major pair, moderate volatility |

**Configuration Path**: `autonomous_config.sl_hunt_recovery.recovery_windows_by_symbol`

Normal trading resumes after the symbol-specific window expires, preventing revenge trading during volatile periods.
